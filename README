Series of scripts used to create and assess linear regressor for prediction of ocean temperature evolution, 
and to plot output from the MITgcm run used as training data.

PlotMITGCM contains scripts to plot he MITgcm data which is used as training and val data.
Plot_MITGCM_sector.py plots instantaneous fields from the model for various cross sections/birds eye views, and plots time series.
CalcAvMITgcmFields.py calculates the average trends (i.e. advection and diffusion), and saves these into another netcdf file.
Plot_AvMITgcmFields.py plots the fields created by CalcAvMITgcmFields.py

LinearRegressionModel/TrainLinearRegressionModel.py creates the linear model and does some assesment
of results over the training and val datasets.

AnalysisScripts contains scripts which provide further analysis of the model performance
Plot_coefficients.py plots the coefficients of the linear model, enabling assessment of which are most heavily weighted.
CalcAvErrors.py makes a number of one-step predictions, and then averages the error from these to give average
error fields which are stored in a netcdf file.
Plot_AvPredFields.py plots the average errors created above, giving cross sections of the spatial patterns of averaged errors.

Tools contains a variety of functions called by other scripts within this code set.
